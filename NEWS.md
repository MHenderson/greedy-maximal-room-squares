# greedy-maximal-room-squares (development version)

# greedy-maximal-room-squares (v0.1.0)

* Reproduce Table 1 from Meszka and Rosa (2021) up to n = 80, giving the volume of maximal partial Room squares constructed by greedy1 and greedy2.
* A targets pipeline with two PNG outputs, a plot and a table, giving volumes for greedy1 and greedy2 for n = 2 to n = 80.
* greedy1 and greedy2 based on the Room class from the wallis package.
* Using ggplot2 3.5.1 for plots and flextable 0.9.6 for tables.
* Tested on Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS (Focal Fossa) with R 4.4.1, renv 1.0.7, targets 1.7.1, wallis 0.0.0.9007
